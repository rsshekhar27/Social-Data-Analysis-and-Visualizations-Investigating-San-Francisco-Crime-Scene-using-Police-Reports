## DTU Social Data Analysis and Visualizations - _Project Portfolio_
### _By Sebastian Sbirna_

This repository contains the collection of projects made for the DTU Data Science course: Social Data Analysis and Visualizations

The course is based on mastering tools for analyzing data sets generated from online social interactions, and is structured around short lectures combined with exercises, as well as a high degree of independent project work.

This course's objective is to enable us to create visualizations of complex data sets and to apply common strategies for understanding the content of media (e.g. text, music, images, etc), and it provides us with a conceptual basis for modeling social data.

The point of the presented Project Assignments is to try out the skills we have learned throughout the course on our own chosen dataset. In particular, we have built a narrative visualization, as defined in the Segel and Heer paper Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data, which lives inside an interactive Observable-Notebook.
