This repository contains the collection of projects made for the DTU Data Science course: _Social Data Analysis and Visualizations_.

The course is based on mastering tools for analyzing data sets generated from online social interactions, and is structured around short lectures combined with exercises, as well as a high degree of independent project work.

This course's objective is to enable us to create ___visualizations of complex data sets___ and to apply common strategies for understanding the content of media (e.g. text, music, images, etc), and it provides us with a ___conceptual basis for modeling social data___.

The point of the presented Project Assignments is to try out the skills we have learned throughout the course on our own chosen dataset. In particular, we have built a ___narrative visualization___, as defined in the Segel and Heer paper _Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data_, which lives inside an interactive __Observable Notebook__.
